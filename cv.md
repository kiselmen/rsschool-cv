### Summary
***
Currently, I work in a huge company as an IT manager, additionally I am engaged in freelance website development. My last project was a site for the game "Mafia". We made it in Vue.js + Vuex as a SPA. Laravel framework was used as an API. Now I decided to expand my knowledge of the front-end by learning React + Redux. I love to code and create something useful, automate processes, making life easier. My strengths are experience of working in large projects in a team, fast learning, and communication. I love working in a friendly team, where you can pass on your experience and get a new one.
